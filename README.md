# MTS to MP4 Bulk Converter

**Powershell Script - Windows Only**

This script was created to help me bulk convert my camcorder's `.MTS` files to `.MP4` while preserving the Record Date **EXIF** metadata. This way it would be properly organized by photo software (iCloud Photos, Google Photos, etc).

I added in some user prompts and options (with defaults) just to make it more interactive and customizable. You can select the input, output, file size, quality, and if you want to encode using your **CPU** or **NVIDIA GPU**. This script has only been tested on **Windows 10**.

## Disclaimer

ChatGPT 4o helped me write this script. Also, always be careful running scripts on your device. This script is intended to be non-destructive (it won't delete your original files), but I have no idea how your system will respond to it. Take caution and backup your files!

## Features

- Converts `.MTS` files to `.MP4` while preserving some original EXIF metadata.
- Offers a choice between **Intel CPU (x264)** and **NVIDIA GPU (NVENC)** for encoding.
- Allows control over encoding speed and file size using **FFmpeg** presets (1-8), with a balanced **medium** preset as the default.
- Automatically names output files based on the **Recorded Date** in the format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.mp4`.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following tools installed and added to your system's **PATH**:

1. [**FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/)  
   FFmpeg is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert, and stream audio and video.  
   Download it [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

2. [**ExifTool**](https://exiftool.org/)  
   ExifTool is a platform-independent Perl library plus a command-line application for reading, writing, and editing meta-information in a wide variety of files.  
   Download it [here](https://exiftool.org/#downloads).
